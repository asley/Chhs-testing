What is meant by 'data redundancy' in a database, and why is it undesirable?**  \n**Data redundancy** occurs when the same data is stored in multiple places, leading to wasted storage, inconsistency, and update anomalies.  \n\n#### **8. Name two database software applications commonly used in businesses.**  \n- **Microsoft Access**  \n- **Oracle Database**  \n- **MySQL** *(Any two of these)*  \n\n#### **9. Explain the term 'query' in the context of databases.**  \nA **query** is a request for specific data from a database, often written in SQL, to retrieve, update, or manipulate records.  \n\n#### **10. What is the difference between 'DELETE' and 'DROP' commands in SQL?**  \n- **DELETE:** Removes specific records from a table but keeps the table structure intact.  \n- **DROP:** Deletes an entire table (or database) along with its structure.  \n\n---  \nThis assessment covers key database concepts for CSEC Information Technology.

**Subject:** CSEC (Data Operations)  
**Topic:** Output Devices  

## **Case Study Scenario: Tech Solutions Inc.**  
Tech Solutions Inc. is a company that provides computer hardware and software solutions to businesses and individuals. The company has recently received multiple requests from clients needing advice on selecting the best output devices for their specific needs.  

As a Data Operations specialist at Tech Solutions Inc., you have been assigned the task of analyzing each client’s requirements and recommending the most suitable output device(s).  

### **Client Requests:**  
1. **A graphic design firm** needs a device to print high-quality, large-scale architectural blueprints.  
2. **A school** wants a device that can display lessons on a large screen for an entire classroom.  
3. **A call center** requires a device that allows employees to listen to audio privately without disturbing colleagues.  
4. **A visually impaired user** needs a device that can convert digital text into tactile output.  
5. **An office** needs a device to produce physical copies of reports and documents.  
6. **A home user** wants a device to watch movies with clear visuals.  
7. **A music studio** needs a device to play high-quality sound output.  
8. **A network administrator** wants a device to display real-time status updates on network equipment.  

### **Assessment Tasks:**  
1. **Identify the most suitable output device for each client.** (8 marks)  
2. **Justify your choice for each recommendation.** (8 marks)  
3. **Explain one advantage and one disadvantage of using a printer compared to a monitor for document output.** (4 marks)  
4. **Discuss how a Braille Reader improves accessibility for visually impaired users.** (5 marks)  

### **Marking Scheme:**  
- **Task 1:** 1 mark per correct device identification (8 marks)  
- **Task 2:** 1 mark per justification (8 marks)  
- **Task 3:** 2 marks for advantage, 2 marks for disadvantage (4 marks)  
- **Task 4:** 5 marks for a well-explained discussion (5 marks)  

**Total Marks: 25**  

### **Expected Answers:**  
1. **Device Identification & Justification:**  
   - **Graphic design firm:** Plotter (produces large-scale blueprints).  
   - **School:** Projector (displays content on a large screen).  
   - **Call center:** Headphones (private audio listening).  
   - **Visually impaired user:** Braille Reader (converts text to tactile braille).  
   - **Office:** Printer (produces physical copies).  
   - **Home user:** Monitor (displays high-quality visuals).  
   - **Music studio:** Speaker (emits high-quality audio).  
   - **Network administrator:** LED Display Panel (shows real-time status).  

2. **Printer vs. Monitor:**  
   - **Advantage of Printer:** Provides a permanent physical copy.  
   - **Disadvantage of Printer:** Requires paper/ink, slower than digital display.  

3. **Braille Reader Accessibility:**  
   - Converts digital text into braille, allowing visually impaired users to read independently.

### **Answer Key**

1.  **c) Random Access Memory (RAM)** - RAM is volatile memory used for temporary storage of active data and programs.
2.  **c) The ROM (BIOS/UEFI)** - The ROM chip contains the firmware (BIOS/UEFI) that initializes hardware during the boot process.
3.  **c) To execute instructions and process data** - The CPU is the "brain" of the computer, performing calculations and executing program instructions.
4.  **d) Input Device** - A barcode reader is used to input data into the computer.
5.  **c) It is non-volatile and stores permanent instructions.** - ROM is non-volatile and contains pre-written, permanent data, like the boot firmware.
6.  **d) Internal Hard Disk Drive (HDD)** - While SSDs are common, high-capacity internal HDDs (e.g., 4TB+) are often larger and more cost-effective for bulk storage than standard SSDs or the other options listed.

### **Answer Key**

1.  a) Much larger storage capacity / b) Much faster read/write speeds / Allows for easy rewriting and deletion of data.
2.  Flash Memory (or NAND Flash Memory).
3.  Write-Once.
4.  External Hard Drive / Network-Attached Storage (NAS) / Digital Video Recorders (DVRs) / Game Consoles.
5.  a) Very small physical size / b) Lightweight / c) Does not require a power cable (powered by USB port).
6.  Data on a CD-ROM is pre-written and cannot be modified or erased, whereas data on a CD-RW can be written, erased, and rewritten multiple times.
7.  Universal Serial Bus.
8.  Reason: It contains spinning magnetic platters and a read/write head that moves across them.
    Disadvantage: More susceptible to physical damage/shocks; slower access time compared to solid-state storage; generates more heat and noise.
9.  Choice: CD.
    Justification: CDs are inexpensive for mass duplication and distribution, and 800 MB fits comfortably on a standard 700MB CD (with some compression or use of a higher-capacity CD). Flash drives are more expensive per unit for a one-time distribution.
10. Choice: CD-R.
    Explanation: CD-Rs are write-once media, making the data permanent and resistant to accidental deletion or alteration, which is ideal for archival purposes. CD-ROMs are not user-writable, and CD-RWs are not suitable as the data can be changed.
